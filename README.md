# Sonus
## _A Pretty Average and Probably Outdated Discord Music Bot_

Sonus, a simple but effective music bot, complete with a skip, stop and a modern queue system.

## Installation
Sonus requires a [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.10+

Make a Discord bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and get its token, and in `sn_core.py`, change the `TOKEN` constant to your bot's  corresponding token.

> Note: This bot might be outdated and not work correctly, as it has not been maintained since 2021 that year. If it does not work, then you can choose to either fix it or use the code for inspiration or your own, its free for you to use, but credit the  original creator. 

## Modules
Sonus currently uses these modules. (Installed via Pip)
- [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/)
- [YoutubeDL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
- [FFmpeg](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python)
- [re](https://pypi.org/project/regex/)

## History
 Created near November, 2021,  when many mainstream Discord music bots were taken offline, Sonus was created as a side project to understand why many music bots were going offline and how powerful this technology of streaming _free_, _24/7_ music on Discord Voice Channels really could be. The main objective though was to experiment with the FFmpeg, YoutubeDL and the Discord Voice Client libraries.
